% Vectors can be created using

%% Simple Creation
ex_vec = [3 2 5];
% OR
ex_vec = [3, 2, 5];

%% Colon notation
% this means create a vector within the range (which is the first and
% third params) and with the increment between adjacent numbers (the third
% param)
x = 5:2:10;
disp(x)

% he second method specifies the range of values and the number of values
% desired.
x = (s:d:f);
%or 
v = [s:d:f];
